## From scratch to MFC
1. Create a resource file (*.rc) in the resources folder;
2. Create a Dialog within your resource file;
3. Add *.cpp (for main function) source file;
4. Add the bare minimum "boilerplate code" for an MFC application;
	- This consists First writing a class that inherits from either CDialog or CFrameWnd;
	- Then write a class that inherits from CWinApp and instantiate the first class from within the second.
	- Finally, add Message Map tags for the CDialog class and instantiate your CWinApp class.


To do:
first, copy SLMfc3DPlayer.cpp
and class SLMfc3DPlayerDlg, then delete as much as possible to get the minimum bone of MFC with CDialog as first class,
then check the difference between CDialog and CWinApp and CFrameWnd.
