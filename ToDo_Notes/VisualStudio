# ShortCut Setting
You have been asked what keyboard binding you want to use at the first use of Visual Studio.
F7 is still available if you answer "C++". If you've chosen the default setting, you have Ctrl-Shift-B as Build command.

You can change the key binding in the menu: Tools/Options -> Environment/Keyboard.
With all that configuration possible in that dialog Microsoft is trying to make their app more flexible and configurable.
