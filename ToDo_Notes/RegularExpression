## To figure out:
 *  "don't" =~ / .+? \b{wb} /x;  # matches the whole string


* Is the string empty?
if ($str eq '') {
    print "String is empty.";
}
That would work, but if use warnings; is in effect, as it should be, then you might get a Use of uninitialized value warnings if $str is undef. So it might be better to check this too, before any other comparison:

* if (not defined $str) {
    print "String is so empty, it is not even defined.";
}
and to do the other comparisons only if $str is defined.

* Has the string only spaces in it?
if ($str =~ /^ *$/) {
    print "String contains 0 or more spaces and nothing else.";
}
* Has the string only white-spaces in it?
if ($str =~ /^\s*$/) {
    print "String contains 0 or more white-space character and nothing else.";
}
