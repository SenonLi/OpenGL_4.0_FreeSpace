## How to add a resource:
To include resources in your Windows-based application with RC, do the following:

1. Create individual files for your cursors, icons, bitmaps, dialog boxes, and fonts.
2. Create a resource-definition script (.rc file) that describes the resources used by your application.
3. Compile the script with RC. For more information, see Using RC (The RC Command Line).
4. Link the compiled resource (.res) file into the application's executable file with your linker.

## Resource-Definition Statements 
The resource-definition statements define the resources that the resource compiler puts in the resource (.Res) file. 
After the .Res file is linked to the executable file, the application can load its resources at run time as needed.
All resource statements associate an identifying name or number with a given resource.

The resource-definition statements can be divided into the following categories:
1. Resources
2. Controls
3. Statements
