* Learn Post Processing using customer framebuffer
* Add subWidget (framebuffer) for second window debugging
* Look Through Explode


## Notes:
### OpenGL
* State Machine Nature : any state that is changed by things that happen main will still be in effect when display is called for the first time, and any state that display changes will still be in effect the next time display is called.

### Camera View
* Problem: screen "shakes" a lot whenever the CameraView (mouse move) changes direction
  Solution: decrease the sensitivity of mouse move (pitch, yaw, scroll).
### Texture
* Parameter: 

-magnification
-minification

### Color Buffer
* Default: reset to (clean) 0x00.

### Depth Buffer
* Default: reset to (clean) 0x01.

### Stencil Buffer
* Default: reset to (clean) 0x00.
* Tip: stencil test (stencil Func) first, check to draw the fragment or not; 
       stencil buffer updating (stencil Oper) second (depends of stencil Mask).
